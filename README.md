2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:
   ```
   cd shamir_secret_sharing
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To use the Shamir's Secret Sharing implementation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're in the project directory
2. Run the script using Node.js:
